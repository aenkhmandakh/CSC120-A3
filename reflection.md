Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted with Dita Nguyen. I was having some trouble with the if else statements and how to optimize them the best to which we discussed a bit and I came up with my current waterfall set up. This way it still made the most sense even if it couldn't replace everything.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I never had time to go to the TA hours because I was out of town friday to sunday and busy for lunar new year, I'm sorry! But because Dita is my roommate and we consulted beforehand, she was able to ask the same questions I had through the TA.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I think it is trickier than python for sure. It is definitely more sensitive, but it is another language just like Python so once I am used to it, it isn't too hard. The shift from using Python was just a bit drastic so I struggled a bit. Because we had done the object oriented programming before in python I think it defintely helped. The python sort of became a pseudocode for me to reference when I tried to figure out Java. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I think the wording differs from language to language but a lot of the principal logic and syntax is the same. For example, both  have variables, loops, if statements functions, operators, etc. It might need to be written slightly different but the main idea behind them is the same. Especially with object oriented programming, much of the set up with constructors remained the same, which is why I think I struggled much less.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think the basic functions worked. It asks for a number of rounds, mirrors certain words in responses, responds with canned responses if there isn't anything to mirror, and has a transcript. However, the mirroring words is still a bit clunky because of the if statements. If there are two instances to mirror, then it only goes with the first one it detects in my if statement. I feel like I could fix it with a different method but I didn't have enough time to explore it.
